I'm a computer hacker since the early 90s, from before the Internet.
Back in the days, I used to write C code offline. By accident, I ended up with Linux,
 BSD, and pretty much all Unix-like operating systems, and a hell lotta networking.

As a professional, I made up my carreer working mostly as a programmer,
but also as systems and network administrator. Over all these years, I
 had contact with some more exotic stuff such as marketing, managing, etc. This mix
led me to entrepreneurship, which resulted in building a couple of companies
from the ground up.

Over the last 10 years, I gave over 500 lectures and speeches, teached Linux,
programming, and networking to thousands of people.

I still write a lot of code, usually open source, not always free software.
Currently, it's mostly Python, Javascript, and some C here and there.

But life is not only about computers...
