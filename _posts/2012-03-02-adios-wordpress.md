I'm about to replace the old, almost deprecated
[coisas lunix](http://fiorix.wordpress.com) blog with this.

[Wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com), it was good while it lasted.

I'm really enjoying experimenting with Jekyll and Bootstrap 2, and the idea
of pushing it all over to a git repo. It's simple, as custom as I like,
very extensible, and it has a lot of cool features.

Go check it out too:
